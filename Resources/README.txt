> About SGP4 model:
- These models predict the effect of perturbations caused by the Earth’s shape (spherical harmonics),
drag, radiation, and gravitation effects from the Sun and Moon.
- The SGP4 model has an error ~1 km at epoch and grows at ~1–3 km per day.
This data must be updated frequently in NASA and NORAD sources due to this error.
